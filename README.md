# DotEnv Switch

## Switch between environmental values in your .env file

### Installation (optional)

1. OPTIONAL. Install the package

```bash
npm i -g dotenv-switch
```

```bash
yarn global add dotenv-switch
```

### Usage

1. Execute the command

```bash
dotenv-switch

After changing some variable, a new `.env.bak` file will be created. This file will be used to restore the original values if something happens.

This package is very young and needs a lot of work. If you want to contribute, please do so. I will be happy to accept your PRs.
